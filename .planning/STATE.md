## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Spec is locked source of truth: Comprehensive system spec already covers schema, API, modules, pricing, deployment
- Core loop first, monitoring/billing later: Get Collect → Analyze → Generate working end-to-end before adding Module 4 and Stripe
- Stub auth during core loop build: Move faster on module development, add real Supabase Auth when connecting frontend
- Real integrations from start (no mocks): Apify and OpenRouter ready, skip mock layer complexity
- Full dashboard from start: End-to-end UI (Next.js) not just API - user wants to see the value loop visually
